Having written the &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; column for that magazine for a span of time so vast, that not only the term &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; but <em>the very notion of a magazine about computer science</em> have both become passé echoes of a bygone world, I find myself in the wake of login&rsquo;s demise, bereft of a cherished and therapudic outlet for my incessently nagging inner-voice.</p><p>If you ever read the column you&rsquo;ll know that of the 2000 words alotted to me, it was a rare issue where I managed to dedicate more than 800 to the subject of monitoring, but no one seemed to mind, and some I know even enjoyed my meandering. Over the years I remember often feeling put-upon by the column, when my own, invariable lack of planning would result in a lost weekend of break-neck research and writing. But now I realize how much I enjoyed the priveledge and, I don&rsquo;t know, zen-esque clarity that came as a side-effect of putting the real world aside for an hour or five to, ya know, <em>write</em> something of substance.</p><p>And so, here we are.</p><p>No promises or anything, I&rsquo;ll probably wander off and forget I wrote this and committed it by tomorrow morning, but if I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll hopefully find some space in my life to sit down and document computer things I learn, rant about my stupid truck, and share some pictures of my dog. Or just, ya know, write for the pleasure of it.</p><p>You&rsquo;re welcome to come along, I can promise that I won&rsquo;t get (too) political, or ever ask you to <em>like and subscribe</em>, and I&rsquo;m far too lazy to set a cookie in your browser to sell you soap, so if you like Computer related crap and maybe Toyota LandCruisers, hop on in.</p><p>Till next time
