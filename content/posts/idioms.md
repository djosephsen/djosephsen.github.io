People often say to me _"gosh Dave, you're so smart"_, to which I respond _I know right? Be sure to like and subscribe_. 

faking it to increasing degrees of complexity 

In every human endeavor there is an all-encompasing superset of things you can do, which is composed of the subset of things you _should_ do, and the subset of things you _should not_. In software engineering we call the former subset -- the one containing things you should do, _idioms_. 

Correct code is said to be "Idiomatic", by which we mean, the code is a marriage of valid syntax and correctly applied idioms. These are orthagonal properties. Code may posess perfectly valid syntax and perform the task it was written to accomplish, and still be _incorrect_, if the idiomatic layer has not been properly applied. As engineers, we typically express this state with olifactory metaphors eg.. "code smell".  If, therefore, you endeavor to be a "good" engineer -- one who writes correct, odorless code -- you will need to concern yourself with the comprehension and proper application of idioms.

Compared with idioms, programming languages are easy to learn. Simply pick up the book or spec, and commit the syntax to memory.  Idioms by comparison are rarely documented, language specific, often counterintuitive and sometimes political and/or controverseal. They don't really generalize, because ultimately they express someone's opinion. By using the word [idiom](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idiom) to describe them, we're outwardly acknowledging these properties. They can't be understood by themselves, they are subjective, and derive from human-oriented context.

Further, as the language grows and opinions change, the idioms will evolve. Unlike syntax, which will remain valid until it is very explicitly deprecated, it's entirely possible to discover and ingest "old", invalid idioms as your reward for otherwise studious research. In fact many of the skills that might make you good at learning languages, can generally work against you in this context.

Why do idioms exist? 

code reviews are a hazing ritual where idioms operate as a sort of spanking paddle.

Lets explore some examples. Some idioms are simple and exist for "readability", for example: _operators (+-=) should have a single space on either side_. Others are complex, and exist for more complex reasons. Sometimes, even when they are documented, they can be difficult to apply, for example I'll take the golang idiom: _exit early_.


hazing... the notion is to create a bond born of commonality of suffering. I want to know that you've suffered as I have. 

the objectionable part is when I enjoy your suffering, which is an invariant side-effect. Athelets enjoy making other atheletes suffer because it makes them feel stronger-than, engineers enjoy it because it makes them feel smarter-than.
